# dynamic-decorator
A sample project to show how to use C# dynamic features to create a dynamic decorator for DTO/ViewModels.

I have been writing blog posts where I explain parts of what goes on in this project. Here a series on how to get rid of INotifyPropertyChanged in my ViewModels:

* [Part 5](https://lassala.net/2017/05/25/fun-with-c-how-to-get-rid-of-inpc-using-dynamic-part-5/)

And here's how I implement adding visual behavior dynamically using the decorator:
